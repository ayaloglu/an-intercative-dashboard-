Here I create an interactive dashboard while using plotly to visualize the data

This dashboard visualizes data which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

You can select sample ID from the dropdown menu to see the specific data for that sample.

Bar graph shows the top 10 microbial species (OTUs, operational taxonomic units) found in that individual. 

Bubble chart shows the abundance of each microbial species in each sample.

Demographic info is also attached to the page for each individual.

The gauge indicates how often each individual washes their belly button.
